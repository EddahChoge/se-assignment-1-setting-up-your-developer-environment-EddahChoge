Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

   OS SETUP PROCESS:
   1. Upgrade via Windows Update (Recommended):
   - If your PC meets the minimum system requirements, you'll receive an upgrade offer via Windows Update      between October 2021 and mid-2022.
   - Check your system specs using Microsoft's PC Health Check app to ensure compatibility.
   - Back up your data before proceeding.

   2. Clean Install (For advanced users):
   - Download the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft's website.
   - Run `mediacreationtool.exe`, choose your language and edition, and select the "USB Flash Drive" option.
   - Let it create a bootable USB drive with Windows 11 (requires at least 8GB of space).

   3. Windows Insider Program:
   - Sign up for the Windows Insider Program to test Windows 11 early.
   - Note that this is a preview build, so back up your data before installing.

   VS CODE INSTALLATION PROCESS:
   1. Download the Installer:
   - Visit the [official VS Code page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview).
   - Download the VS Code EXE file.

   2. Run the Installer:
   - Execute the downloaded file.
   - Accept the terms and conditions.
   - Click Next and then Install.

   3. Launch VS Code:
   - After installation, click the Launch button.

   That's it! You're ready to start coding with VS Code!

   GIT AND GITHUB SETUP PROCEDURE:
   1. Create a GitHub Account:
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account.
   - Choose a username, enter your email, and set a password.

   2. Install Git Locally:
   - Download and install the latest version of Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).
   - If you're using Chrome OS, follow the instructions in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git#setting-up-git)   to enable Git.

   3. Configure Git:
   - Set your username using: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`.
   - Set your commit email address using: `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`.

   4. Authentication:
   - Connect to GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH:
     - For HTTPS, cache your credentials using a credential helper.
     - For SSH, generate SSH keys on each computer you use.

   5. Next Steps:
   - You're all set! Now you can create a repository to store your projects on GitHub.
   - Consider forking repositories to make changes without affecting the original

   PYTHON INSTALLATION:
   1. Go to the official Python website:
   - Visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python (Python 3.x). ![alt text](<Python Image.png>)

   2. Download and Install Python:
   - Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - During installation, make sure to check the option to add Python to your system PATH.

   3. Verify the Installation:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.
   - You should see the version number (e.g., Python 3.12.4). ![alt text](<Python Image 1.png>)

   4. Start Coding:
   - Now that Python is installed, you're ready to write and run Python programs.
   - Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to create Python files (with a `.   py` extension) and start coding!

   MySQL database Installation:

   1. Windows:
   - Download the MySQL Installer from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
   - Choose the appropriate version (MySQL 8.0.37) and download the MSI installer.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - During installation, you can configure MySQL Server using the MySQL Configurator tool.

   2. *Ubuntu (Linux):
   - Update the package index on your server:
   - Install the `mysql-server` package:
   - Start the MySQL service:

   3. Other Platforms (Unix/Linux, macOS, Solaris):
   - Refer to the [official MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) for detailed instructions.
